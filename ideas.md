  <design_movement>Modern Minimalist Luxury</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Essentialism**: Only the necessary elements are present; every pixel serves a purpose.
    2. **Sophistication through Typography**: Relying heavily on typeface quality and typesetting rather than ornamentation.
    3. **Serene Atmosphere**: The site should feel like a breath of fresh air—calm, organized, and exclusive.
    4. **Impeccable Spacing**: Generous whitespace to convey luxury and time (the ultimate luxury).
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Champagne & Slate"**: A palette that whispers rather than shouts.
    - Primary: Deep Charcoal/Slate (Authority, Stability)
    - Background: Warm Off-White/Cream (Comfort, Human touch)
    - Accent: Muted Gold/Champagne (Elegance, Wealth without tackiness)
    - *Reasoning*: High-net-worth individuals value discretion and warmth over flashy displays.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Asymmetric Editorial**:
    - Breaking the grid to create visual interest.
    - Overlapping elements (images over text, text over images) to feel like a high-end magazine.
    - Sticky scrolling elements that stay with the user, offering assistance (like a concierge).
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Thin Line Art**: Delicate 1px lines separating sections or framing images.
    2. **Monogram Watermarks**: Subtle, large-scale usage of the "A" or logo mark as a background texture.
    3. **Floating Action Button (WhatsApp)**: Elegant, not intrusive, perhaps with a "May we assist you?" label.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"The Invisible Hand"**: Interactions should be smooth and anticipating.
    - Hover effects that are slow and ease-in, not snappy.
    - Parallax scrolling that feels weighty and grounded.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    - **Fade & Rise**: Elements slowly fade in and rise up as they enter the viewport.
    - **Image Reveal**: Images scale down slightly from a zoomed state upon loading (Ken Burns effect).
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* (Serif) - Classic, editorial, trustworthy.
    - **Body**: *Lato* or *Montserrat* (Sans-serif) - Clean, modern, legible.
    - **Hierarchy**: Large, airy headings with small, tracked-out overlines (e.g., "OUR SERVICES").

  <design_movement>Dark Mode Avant-Garde</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Exclusivity**: A dark interface feels private, like a VIP lounge or a black card.
    2. **Cinematic Immersion**: High-contrast visuals that pop against the dark background.
    3. **Precision**: Sharp lines and high-tech feel, suggesting efficiency and exactness.
    4. **Focus**: Dark backgrounds reduce eye strain and focus attention purely on the content/service.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Midnight & Neon"**:
    - Background: Rich Black/Deep Navy (Infinite depth)
    - Text: Silver/Cool Grey (Modernity)
    - Accent: Electric Blue or Emerald Green (Subtle glow for active elements)
    - *Reasoning*: Suggests a 24/7 service that operates in the background of your life, always ready.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Split-Screen & Cards**:
    - Vertical split screens for desktop (Image | Content).
    - Glassmorphism cards for services, floating above the dark background.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects for navigation and cards.
    2. **Glow Effects**: Subtle ambient light behind key elements.
    3. **Vertical Navigation**: A side navigation bar instead of top, mimicking a dashboard or app.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Fluid Response"**:
    - Elements react magnetically to the cursor.
    - Buttons have a "glow" on hover.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    - **Staggered Reveal**: Lists and cards appear one by one with a quick snap.
    - **Smooth Scroll**: Custom scroll damping for a premium feel.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings**: *Cormorant Garamond* (Serif) - Sharp, elegant, slightly aggressive.
    - **Body**: *Inter* or *DM Sans* - Neutral, functional.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Organic Humanist</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Warmth & Care**: The focus is on the human aspect of assistance.
    2. **Softness**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, organic shapes.
    3. **Trust**: Using imagery of people, hands, and lifestyle scenes.
    4. **Flow**: The layout should flow like a conversation.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Sand & Sea"**:
    - Background: Warm Beige/Sand (Natural, grounding)
    - Primary: Soft Sage Green or Terracotta (Organic, life)
    - Text: Dark Brown/Coffee (Softer than black)
    - *Reasoning*: Lifestyle assistance is personal; the site should feel approachable and nurturing, not cold or corporate.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Fluid Grid**:
    - Elements are not strictly aligned; they float in a balanced composition.
    - Curved section dividers (waves or organic blobs).
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Organic Shapes**: Blobs or soft rectangles behind images.
    2. **Hand-drawn Icons**: Custom illustrations that feel sketched.
    3. **Testimonial Focus**: Large, prominent quotes from happy clients.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Gentle Touch"**:
    - Buttons depress softly when clicked.
    - Images have a soft "breathing" animation (subtle scale up/down).
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    - **Morphing Shapes**: Background shapes slowly change form.
    - **Fade In**: Content gently fades in as you scroll.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings**: *Tenor Sans* - Humanist, open, friendly.
    - **Body**: *Source Sans Pro* - Readable, approachable.
